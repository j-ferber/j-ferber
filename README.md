### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Justin. I am currently a third-year student at Stevens Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in Software Engineering. On my GitHub, you will find projects and work that I have done both in and out of school. Some things I enjoy doing in my free time are sports, video games, and hanging out with the great people around me.
